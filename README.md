# FilesOnCloud
Files uploading into Database using Django

Files on Cloud is a Django project to upload photos or files into Database.
This project uses default sqlite3 as its database, we can change according to our needs.

In this project, 3 pages there - User registration, User login(home page) and Uploads.
Registered users can login directly while new users can register first.

One must be logged in to upload files.
In the uploads page, after entering file name and the file, we can upload it to db.
Thus, we can save our files safely in a database.

To use this project, just clone this repository into your computer and you can start using it.
